# Deployment
- Railway and most other deployment services do not support opening devices like webcam, so the live attendance capturing feature only works locally, I am looking to make it such that it works via file upload client side or using an external ESP module(i.e the ESP CAM module) for image capturing and face recognition.
- But for now the rest of the app's functioning is deployed on
